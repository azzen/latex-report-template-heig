Hi everyone!

\begin{theorem}[Stokes' theorem]
    Let \(\Sigma\) be a smooth oriented surface in \(\R^3\) with boundary \(\partial\Sigma\). If a vector field \(F(x, y, z) = (F_x(x, y, z), F_y(x, y, z), F_z(z, y, z))\) is defined and has continuous first order partial derivatives in a region containing \(\Sigma\) then

    \[
        \iint_\Sigma (\nabla \cross F) \cdot d^2\Sigma = \oint_{\partial\Sigma} F \cdot d\Gamma
    \]
\end{theorem}
